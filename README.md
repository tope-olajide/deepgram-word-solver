This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
Clone this repo:
https://github.com/tope-olajide/deepgram-word-solver.git

Install all dependencies:
"npm install"

Signup at [https://deepgram.com/](https://deepgram.com/) to generate a free API key.
create a .env file and your API like so:
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY = XXXXxXXxXxXXxXxXXXxXxXXxxxxXXXxxXXxXxXXxxxxxxX

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/textToSpeech](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/textToSpeech.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
